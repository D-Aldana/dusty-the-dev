      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Wisdumb is a daily quote app that generates humorous, pseudo-profound quotes. Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what data we collect and how we use it.</p>

      <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Anonymous account ID:</strong> When you first open the app, an anonymous account is created automatically. No email, name, or personal information is required.</li>
        <li><strong>Quotes and favorites:</strong> The quotes generated for you and any favorites you save are stored in our database, linked to your anonymous account.</li>
        <li><strong>Notification preferences:</strong> If you set a daily reminder time, that preference is stored with your account.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data We Do Not Collect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>No personal information (name, email, phone number)</li>
        <li>No location data</li>
        <li>No contacts or photos</li>
        <li>No usage analytics or tracking</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Supabase:</strong> Used for authentication and data storage. <a href="https://supabase.com/privacy">Supabase Privacy Policy</a></li>
        <li><strong>OpenAI:</strong> Used to generate quotes. No user data is sent to OpenAI — only a generic prompt. <a href="https://openai.com/privacy">OpenAI Privacy Policy</a></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
      <p>Your data is stored securely on Supabase servers with row-level security policies that ensure users can only access their own data. All communication between the app and our servers is encrypted via HTTPS.</p>

      <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
      <p>Since accounts are anonymous, you can delete your data by uninstalling the app. If you would like your data removed from our servers, contact us at the email below.</p>

      <h2>Children&apos;s Privacy</h2>
      <p>Wisdumb is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.</p>

      <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected on this page with an updated date.</p>
