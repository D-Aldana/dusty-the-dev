            identifier, we may not be able to locate specific entries on our

      <h2>How to delete your reflections</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Open the Manna app.</li>
        <li>
          Go to your <strong>History</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>Open the reflection you want to remove.</li>
        <li>
          Tap <strong>Delete</strong> and confirm. The reflection is permanently
          removed from our servers.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Repeat for any other reflections you want to delete.</p>

      <h2>Delete everything at once</h2>
      <p>
        Because Manna has no account, you can remove all of your data by{" "}
        <strong>uninstalling the app</strong> (this clears any reflections saved
        only on your device) and deleting your saved reflections from History as
        described above before uninstalling.
      </p>

      <h2>What is deleted and what is kept</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Deleted:</strong> Your reflection text, the returned verse,
          commentary, and prayer — permanently removed when you delete a
          reflection.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Kept:</strong> Anonymous, non-identifying operational data
          such as aggregate daily usage counts and short-lived rate-limit
          records used to prevent abuse. This data is not linked to you and is
          not personally identifiable. Rate-limit records expire automatically
          within roughly one hour.
        </li>
      </ul>
