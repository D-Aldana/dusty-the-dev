        Hi, I&apos;m Dustin! I grew up in a small city in British Columbia,
        Canada, and my journey in tech began when I moved to Vancouver Island to
        play university baseball. It was there that I discovered my passion for
        building things with code. After graduation, I spent two months
        backpacking solo across Europe, creating unforgettable experiences,
        enjoying amazing food, and collecting stories I&apos;d love to share!
      </p>

        When I&apos;m not coding, you can usually find me at the kickboxing gym,
        strategizing over a game of chess, or being too emotionally invested in
        my favourite teams (go Blue Jays and Liverpool). I love blending focus
        and fun in all areas of life.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I&apos;m currently based in Victoria, BC, and I&apos;m always excited to
        collaborate on meaningful projects, learn new things, and make a
        positive impact wherever I can.
